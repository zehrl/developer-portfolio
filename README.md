## Description

### What was the assignment?

In this assignment, I was tasked to develop a responsive portfolio for a web developer (in this case, myself).

### Why?

To help develop my understanding of media queries and general knowledge of what I've learned on HTML & CSS.

## How?

**Media Queries (Magic)**

By utilizing different Media Queries at specified "max-width"s, I was able to scale down different features such as my main introduction text & hide elements such as the "Contact Me" text in the footer.

### What did I learn?

In this assignment, I was able to learn about various topics such as:
* Learning to write informative & adequate README files
* Inserting images into a website
* Flexbox use
* Media Queries
